# Technical test for Circl.es

This application was created with React and Illustrator. 

The main goal is to implement as closely as possible the UI presented on the file sent, using html/css and a framework of my choice.

The deployed Application can be accessed at https://andre4130.github.io/circles/

When opening the Application, two circles will appear and the user can interact with both circles.
The circle on the left can change the state of the indicators by clicking directly on top of them. There are three states for the indicators: unlit, lit and broken.
The circle on the right can modified using the control panel on the right: the user can change the name of the circle (limited to 14 characters), and add broken and lit indicators. The reset button will return the circle to its initial state. 

## Instructions for Installing the Application

1. Clone this repository (Master branch)
2. Install npm and node (if not yet installed)
3. Open a Terminal in the project root and execute `npm install`
4. Execute `npm start` to start the application 

## Notes

1. The application is not fully responsive and it's best seen on wider screens. It was given priority to the interactivity and neat implementation of the proposed UI. However, making this application responsive would not be a problem.
